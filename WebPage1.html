    <p> <!-- Paragraph tag for creating a paragraph -->
        The <i><u>appspec.yml</u></i> file is a crucial component used by AWS CodeDeploy, a
        deployment service that automates the deployment of applications to various
        compute services such as Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, and AWS Fargate.
    </p>

    <p>
        The format and content of the <i><u>appspec.yml</u></i> file vary depending on the target
        compute platform (EC2/On-Premises, AWS Lambda, or AWS Fargate). Below, I will
        detail the structures for both EC2/On-Premises and AWS Lambda deployments. AWS
        Fargate deployments follow similar principles to EC2 but are configured to
        work within containerized environments.
